ProjectCtrl Application

ProjectCtrl is a full-stack web application for project management, featuring a React frontend and a Laravel backend. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete projects with real-time updates in the UI. The entire application is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.
‚ú® Features

    Full-Stack Architecture: React frontend for dynamic user interfaces and Laravel backend for robust API services.

    Project Management: Create, view, update, and delete projects through a dedicated API.

    Dynamic Sidebar: Real-time updates to the project list when projects are added, modified, or removed, without requiring a full page refresh.

    Project Details View: Displays detailed information for the currently selected project.

    User Authentication: Includes client-side handling for user data (local storage) and logout functionality, interacting with a backend authentication system.

    Responsive UI: Built with Tailwind CSS for an adaptive user experience across various devices.

    Containerized Deployment: Utilizes Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup and consistent environments.

üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

    Node.js: v18.x or later (includes npm)

        Download Node.js

    Docker Desktop: For building and running Docker containers.

        Download Docker Desktop

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get ProjectCtrl up and running on your local machine using Docker Compose.
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/JustinBolivar/Project-Management-System.git
cd projectctrl-root-directory # Navigate to the root of your project

2. Environment Configuration

There is one .env file located in the root of your Laravel project that handles configuration for both the backend and the frontend (via Vite).

Generate your own .env file if it doesn't exist:

    Start your Docker Compose services (temporarily):
    Navigate to the root of your project and run:

    docker compose up -d app

    This will bring up just the app (Laravel PHP-FPM) service.

    Generate .env from example and a new application key:
    Execute the following commands within the app container to copy the example environment file and generate a unique application key:

    docker compose exec app cp .env.example .env
    docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate

    Stop the temporary container:

    docker compose down

    Edit the generated .env file:
    Open the newly created .env file in the root of your Laravel project. You'll need to verify and update the following variables to ensure they work correctly within the Docker Compose environment:

    APP_NAME=Laravel
    APP_ENV=local
    APP_KEY=base64:... # This will be automatically generated by `php artisan key:generate`
    APP_DEBUG=true
    APP_TIMEZONE=UTC
    APP_URL=http://web # IMPORTANT: This points to the 'web' service within the Docker network
    VITE_APP_URL=http://web # IMPORTANT: This also points to the 'web' service
    VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL=http://vite:5173 # IMPORTANT: This points to the 'vite' service within the Docker network

    # Database Configuration (for SQLite within the Docker container)
    DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
    DB_DATABASE=/var/www/html/database/database.sqlite # Path inside the Docker container

    # You can leave other settings as their default values for development,
    # or configure them as needed.

    Ensure the APP_KEY is present and unique. The APP_URL, VITE_APP_URL, and VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL are crucial for internal Docker networking and Vite integration.

üê≥ Running with Docker Compose

This project uses Docker Compose to manage its services.
1. Place docker-compose.yml and Backend Dockerfile

Ensure your docker-compose.yml file and the Laravel Dockerfile are in the root of the project directory, as they define how your services are built and run.

The Dockerfile provided is for the Laravel backend:

# Dockerfile for Laravel Backend
FROM php:8.2-fpm-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /var/www/html

# Install dependencies
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    git \
    curl \
    libxml2-dev \
    sqlite-dev \
    nodejs \
    npm \
    linux-headers

# Install PHP extensions
RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo_sqlite exif pcntl bcmath sockets

# Get latest Composer
COPY --from=composer:latest /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer

# Copy package files and install npm dependencies (for Laravel's JS dependencies, if any)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY --chown=www-data:www-data . /var/www/html
COPY docker/entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["entrypoint.sh"]

# Expose port 9000 and run php-fpm
EXPOSE 9000
CMD ["php-fpm", "-F"]

2. Start the Services

From the root of your project directory, run the following command to build and start all services defined in docker-compose.yml:

docker compose up --build -d

    --build: Rebuilds images if there are changes to your Dockerfiles.

    -d: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

This command will:

    Build the app service (Laravel PHP-FPM) using the provided Dockerfile.

    Start the vite service (your React development server), which will install frontend dependencies and run npm run dev.

    Start the web service (Nginx) to serve your Laravel backend.

    Establish internal networking between these services.

3. Run Laravel Migrations

Once the containers are up, you'll need to run Laravel's database migrations. You can do this by executing a command within the app container:

docker compose exec app php artisan migrate

4. Seed the Database (Optional)

If you want to populate your database with demo data (a demo user, projects, and tasks), you can run the provided seeder.

The DemoSeeder will create:

    A user with:

        Name: Demo User

        Email: demo@example.com

        Password: password

    3 projects associated with this demo user.

    5 tasks for each of those 3 projects.

To run the seeder, execute the following command within the app container:

docker compose exec app php artisan db:seed --class=DemoSeeder

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

    Access the Frontend (React App):
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    üëâ http://localhost:5173

    This will serve your React application via the Vite development server running in the vite Docker service.

    Access the Backend API (Laravel App):
    Your React frontend will make API calls to:
    üëâ http://localhost:8000/api

    This endpoint is handled by the web (Nginx) and app (PHP-FPM) Docker services.

    Login: If you ran the seeder, you can log in using demo@example.com and password password. Otherwise, you'll need to register or use existing credentials.

    Create New Project: Click the "New Project" button in the sidebar to create a new project.

    Select Project: Click on a project name in the sidebar to view its details.

    Update/Delete Project: Hover over a project in the sidebar, click the "..." menu, and select "Update" or "Delete".

üí° Important Notes

    API Client Configuration: Your apiClient.js is correctly configured to point to http://localhost:8000/api and includes an interceptor for authToken from localStorage.

    Vite Hot Module Replacement (HMR): The vite service provides HMR for the React frontend, meaning changes to your React code should reflect instantly in the browser without a full page refresh.

    Laravel Development: For backend development, you'll typically interact with the app service for artisan commands (e.g., php artisan make:model).

    Nginx Configuration: The docker/nginx/nginx.conf file is crucial for Nginx to correctly route requests to your Laravel PHP-FPM service. Ensure it's properly configured for your Laravel project.
